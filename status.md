### Project Status

The rules are aligned with the version [1.5.0](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg/tree/v1.5.0) of the OWASP MASTG. While complete coverage of all tests cannot be guaranteed, the authors have made significant efforts to provide a comprehensive overview of the status of each implemented rule.  
The presence of False Positives (FP) is expected but limited and efforts have been done to reduce the potential occurrence of False Negatives (FN).

The grade of maturity and the reliability of each rule has been classified according to the following categories:  
:heavy_check_mark: Complete: the rule is highly reliable, although there may be some false positives.  
:thumbsup: Good: the rule is reliable but there may be false negatives.  
:broken_heart: Partial: the rule does not sufficiently cover all static tests.  
:sweat_smile: Tentative: the rule is based on a generous simplification of the static tests.  
:x: Infeasible: the rule can not be implemented with the current free version of Semgrep.
